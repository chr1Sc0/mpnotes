### Users and Groups

The users and groups can be configured at the Tenant level.

The user privileges could be:
  1. User Administrator: Allows a user to create, edit and delete user accounts
  2. Tenant Administrator: Allows a user to create, edit and delete tenants.
  3. Tenant Viewer: Allows a user to switch to other tenants.
  4. App Administrator: Allows a user to create, edit and delete apps.

The "Tenants" tab can be used to assign the tenants for the user (could be more than one).
